## Functionalities
 - Profile: Every single student may have a account so they can log in and make good use of the application. That profile could carry on some informations that will be usefull to the teacher, in order to be prepare for the class. Each teacher will also have a profile, so they can prepare themselves, gave acess to the content, and a studyzone, like a reasearch group, so we could build up the methodology all together.
 - Video Conference: It's the main part of the App. Students can have acess and see what teacher is available on what time. In the beginning, it would be hard, but than, it can get better. 
 - Foruns: Students could use the foruns to ask question and interact with others students. Teacher may also go there and help others with their needs.
